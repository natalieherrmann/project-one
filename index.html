      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm Natalie Herrmann, a fourth-year undergraduate at Illinois Institute
      of Technology majoring in Psychology and minoring in Computer Science. The
      intersection between psychology and technology, or cyberpsychology, is my
      main interest.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of potential in technology—it can be used to increase
      accessibility, engagement, convenience, and connections. But, it can also
      be overwhelming and addicting, inducing nomophobia or a fear of missing
      out. The way we interact with technology and its ability to benefit or
      hurt us is fascinating to me.</p>
      <p>My interest in this area first sparked after my first computer science
      class, which emphasized that one must always consider the user when
      creating a program. I truly enjoyed taking a user-centered design approach
      and all the programming I had to do for assignments. After that class, I
      began pursuing a minor in Computer Science and became a Teaching Assistant
      for it for the following two semesters.</p>
