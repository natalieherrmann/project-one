        <h3>PYSC 381: Human Issues in Technology</h3>
      </header>
      <p>As the title suggests, this class focused on how technology impacts
      our life. Notable topics that we discussed pertaining to technology's
      ever increasing presence include the fear of missing out (FOMO), online
      dating, privacy and surveillance, smart technology design, and
      technological communication's impact on empathy, language, and
      relationships.</p>

        <h3>COM 371: Persuasion</h3>
      </header>
      <p>After learning about persuasion and propaganda throughout the
      semester, I focused on persuasive web design for my final research paper.
      As there are millions of websites on the Internet, each website must have
      a design that persuades users to stay on their site. While aesthetics,
      credibility, and usability were key features of persuasive web design, <a
      href="https://darkpatterns.org/">dark patterns</a> were one of the most
      interesting things I learned about. Dark patterns include tricks such as
      hiding or burying "No" or "Delete Account" buttons, making confusing
      opt-in/opt-out selections for marketing emails, and disguising ads to
      garner clicks.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, a website's design should be persuasive enough to deter
      you from hitting the back button, but a site that uses dark patterns may
      redirect you so many times the back button never lets you out!</p>

        <h3>HUM 372: Interactive Storytelling</h3>
      </header>
      <p>This course focused on elements of worldbuilding, character design,
      and storytelling in relation to interactive mediums (e.g. video games).
      I enjoyed learning how to use the affordances of a particular medium and
      consider the user/player when designing an interactive experience.</p>
      <p>For our final project, we worked in groups to create a game about a
      historical event in Chicago using Twine. You can play my group's game
      about the Chicago's World Fair <a

        <h3>Interprofessional Projects (IPRO): Designed for Silence</h3>
      </header>
      <p>The purpose of this IPRO was to find ways for people to disconnect
      from technology and form a healthier, balanced relationship with the tech
      in their life. As a class, we focused on designing spaces in cities
      around the world that would allow people to get a break from technology.
      In smaller groups, we concentrated on particular cities.</p>
      <p>My group's city was Tokyo. After researching technological usage and
      culture in Tokyo, we came up with ideas that could improve
      already-existing cat cafes to promote opportunities to disconnect and
      de-stress.</p>
      <p>At the Spring 2018 IPRO day, my whole class won the <a
      href="https://iit.edu/news/iittoday/?p=73937">Dean's Choice Award</a>
      from the School of Architecture.</p>

      ethical issues relating to the history of computers and technology.</p>
