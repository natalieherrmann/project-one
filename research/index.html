      <h1>Repetitive Experiences and Behavior Lab (REBL)</h1>
      <p>During the last three years of my undergraduate academic career, I have been fortunate enough to serve as a team member in the clinical psychological research laboratory, <a href="https://rebl-iit.org/">REBL</a>.</p>
      <p>As a part of this lab, I have been involved in a new study testing whether a virtual reality (VR) immersion can motivate individuals with hoarding disorder to pursue behavioral treatment. This immersion is based on using VR to show participants what several rooms in their home would look like without the clutter in the hope that it enhances their motivation for change.</p>
      <p>When participants complete the study, I meet with them to draft a floor plan, recreate rooms of their house using the design software Planner5D, and then monitor the participantâ€™s immersion experience as they view the virtual replica of their home.</p>
      <p>My overall responsibilities in the lab include managing the VR equipment, conducting phone screens, scheduling participants, and running participants in the study. In addition, I have assisted graduate students in their research by helping them code data and run participants.</p>
      <p>Participating in weekly lab meetings, being a part of the inception of a new study, and interacting with graduate students in the lab has given me a lot of insight on the research process and the expectations of graduate research programs.</p>
