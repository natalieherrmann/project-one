        <h2>Repetitive Experiences and Behavior Lab (REBL)</h2>
      </header>
      <p>During the last three years of my undergraduate academic career, I have been fortunate enough to serve as a team member in the clinical psychological research laboratory, <a href="https://rebl-iit.org/">REBL</a>.</p>
      <p>As a part of this lab, I have been involved in a new study testing whether a virtual reality (VR) immersion can motivate individuals with hoarding disorder to pursue behavioral treatment. This immersion is based on using VR to show participants what several rooms in their home would look like without the clutter in the hope that it enhances their motivation for change.</p>
      <p>When participants complete the study, I meet with them to draft a floor plan, recreate rooms of their house using the design software Planner5D, and then monitor the participantâ€™s immersion experience as they view the virtual replica of their home.</p>
      <p>My overall responsibilities in the lab include managing the VR equipment, conducting phone screens, scheduling participants, and running participants in the study. In addition, I have assisted graduate students in their research by helping them code data and run participants.</p>
      <p>Participating in weekly lab meetings, being a part of the inception of a new study, and interacting with graduate students in the lab has given me a lot of insight on the research process and the expectations of graduate research programs.</p>

      <p>In this course, I worked with a group to replicate a pre-publication psychological study about culture. It was a great oppurtunity to conduct a research project from start to finish. For this project, I got to fill out an IRB application, create a survey with qualtrics, recruit participants, analyze data, write a paper, create a poster, and then present. My group won first place at the poster competition for this study at our <a href="https://humansciences.iit.edu/2017-undergraduate-research-day">Lewis College Undergraduate Second Annual Research Day</a>.</p>
      <p>Our study was largely based on the work of Markus and Kitayama (1991) in their paper <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/publications/1991%20Markus%20Kitayama%20Culture%20and%20the%20self.pdf">Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation</a>.</p>
      <p>Markus and Kitayama (1991) propose that those in individualistic cultures have an independent self and are more likely to describe themselves in terms of personal traits and characteristics (e.g. "I am smart, funny, athletic, and kind"); while those from collectivist cultures have an interdependent self and are more likely to describe themselves in terms of their social relationships and roles (e.g. "I am a good son, brother, and friend").</p>
      <p>They argue that self-construals are important because they affect cognition (how we perceive ourselves), motivation (e.g. do we want to fit in or stand out), and emotion (e.g. how you feel after a failure, mere disappointment or shame). However, past research to support these self construals has been varied. Some studies find differences between culture, while some find none, and some even find the opposite of what would be expected.</p>
      <p>Our replication study aimed to find conclusive results about how to assess the differences in self style between collectivist and individualist cultures.</p>

        <h2>PSYC 409: Psychological Testing</h2>
      </header>
      <p>For this course, we got to apply our growing knowledge of psychological testing by creating our own test. I worked with a group to create a test to measure IIT students' attitudes towards success.</p>
      <p>To encompass the attitudes that IIT students have towards success, we created items to measure thoughts towards grades, classwork, attendance, status, income, material possesions, social relationships, autonomy, and stereotypes of successful individuals. After creating our intitial set of items, we had subject-matter experts (fellow classmates) evaluate the effectiveness of each item to strengthen the content validity of our measure.</p>
      <p>If you would like to see the scale we created or here more about this project, feel free to <a href="mailto:nherrma1@hawk.iit.edu">contact me</a>.</p>
