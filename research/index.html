        <h3>Repetitive Experiences and Behavior Lab (REBL)</h3>
      </header>
      <p>During the last three years of my undergraduate academic career,
      I have been fortunate enough to serve as a team member in the clinical
      psychological research laboratory, <a href="https://rebl-iit.org/">REBL</a>.</p>
      <p>As a part of this lab, I have been involved in a new study testing
      whether a virtual reality (VR) immersion can motivate individuals with
      hoarding disorder to pursue behavioral treatment. This immersion is
      based on using VR to show participants what several rooms in their home
      would look like without the clutter in the hope that it enhances their
      motivation for change.</p>
      <p>When participants complete the study, I meet with them to draft a
      floor plan, recreate rooms of their house using the design software
      Planner5D, and then monitor the participantâ€™s immersion experience as
      they view the virtual replica of their home.</p>
      <p>My overall responsibilities in the lab include managing the VR
      equipment, conducting phone screens, scheduling participants, and running
      participants in the study. In addition, I have assisted graduate students
      in their research by helping them code data and run participants.</p>
      <p>Participating in weekly lab meetings, being a part of the inception of
      a new study, and interacting with graduate students in the lab has given
      me a lot of insight on the research process and the expectations of
      graduate research programs.</p>

      <p>Over the summer, I participated in an 8-week Research Experience for
      Undergraduate (REU) program at University of Southern California's
      Information Science Institute. As a part of this program, I experienced
      what it's like working full-time on a research project and learned how
      expensive LA is.</p>
      <p>At a high-level, our research project's aim was to find undiscovered
      nuance in old data to improve future applications. Specifically, the
      project looked for instances of Simpson's Paradox, a phenomenon where a
      trend for an aggregated population is different, perhaps opposite, of
      trends for disaggregated subgroups, within a forecasting competition, a
      contest where individuals make geopolitical predictions. Forecasting
      competitions began as a means of identifying what types of individuals
      excel at consistently making accurate predictions. From the competition,
      these high-performing individuals came to be known as superforecasters.
      Overall, the goal of our project was to improve what we know about
      superforecasters so that in the future it would be possible to predict
      them in advance.</p>
      <p>For this project, I synthesized prior literature and research about
      forecasting competitions to come up with new questions, wrote a program
      to calculate standardized Brier scores (the metric of accuracy for
      forecasting), cleaned and analyzed the data, wrote a paper, and created
      and presented a poster at ISI's local poster day and Southern
      California's REU student conference.</p>
      <p>I'll be presenting presenting this work at the 2019 Lewis College
      Undergraduate Research Day! If you would like to know more about it now,

      <p>In this course, I worked with a group to replicate a pre-publication
      psychological study about culture. It was a great opportunity to conduct
      a research project from start to finish. For this project, I got to fill
      out an IRB application, create a survey with Qualtrics, recruit
      participants, analyze data, write a paper, create a poster, and then
      present. My group won first place at the poster competition for this
      study at our <a
      href="https://humansciences.iit.edu/2017-undergraduate-research-day">Lewis
      College Undergraduate Second Annual Research Day</a>.</p>
      <p>Our study was largely based on the work of Markus and Kitayama (1991)
      in their paper <a
      href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/publications/1991%20Markus%20Kitayama%20Culture%20and%20the%20self.pdf">
      Culture and the self: Implications
      for cognition, emotion, and motivation</a>.</p>
      <p>Markus and Kitayama (1991) propose that those in individualistic
      cultures have an independent self and are more likely to describe
      themselves in terms of personal traits and characteristics (e.g. "I am
      smart, funny, athletic, and kind"); while those from collectivist
      cultures have an interdependent self and are more likely to describe
      themselves in terms of their social relationships and roles (e.g. "I am a
      good son, brother, and friend").</p>
      <p>They argue that self-construals are important because they affect
      cognition (how we perceive ourselves), motivation (e.g. do we want to fit
      in or stand out), and emotion (e.g. how you feel after a failure, mere
      disappointment or shame). However, past research to support these self
      construals has been varied. Some studies find differences between
      culture, while some find none, and some even find the opposite of what
      would be expected.</p>
      <p>Our replication study aimed to find conclusive results about how to
      assess the differences in self style between collectivist and
      individualist cultures.</p>

        <h3>PSYC 409: Psychological Testing</h3>
      </header>
      <p>For this course, we got to apply our growing knowledge of
      psychological testing by creating our own test. I worked with a group to
      create a test to measure IIT students' attitudes towards success.</p>
      <p>To encompass the attitudes that IIT students have towards success, we
      created items to measure thoughts towards grades, classwork, attendance,
      status, income, material possessions, social relationships, autonomy, and
      stereotypes of successful individuals. After creating our initial set of
      items, we had subject-matter experts (fellow classmates) evaluate the
      effectiveness of each item to strengthen the content validity of our
      measure.</p>

      project, feel free to <a href="mailto:nherrma1@hawk.iit.edu">contact
